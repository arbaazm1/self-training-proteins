## Processed Data
Each folder consists of one data set, with four relevant files:
- ``wt.fasta`` contains the wild-type sequence
- ``data.csv`` contains the fitness data, where the ``log-fitness`` column is the
    log enrichment ratio or other measurements of fitness (could be negative) and
    the ``n_mut`` column indicates the distance from the wild-type sequence
- ``seqs.fasta`` and ``seqs.txt`` are the list of protein variant sequences present in the data
